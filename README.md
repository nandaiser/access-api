# 🔐 Access API

A simple and modular backend API built with **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**, designed to manage access-related data using a lightweight SQLite database. 
This project demonstrates backend fundamentals like routing, data modeling, and project structure in Python.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ RESTful API using Flask
- 🗃️ SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- 📂 Clean, modular project structure
- ⚙️ Easy to extend for role-based access control or user systems

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nandaiser/access-api.git
   cd access-api
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
